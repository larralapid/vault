# Obsidian
dashboard in [[Notes/001 - Inbox/obsidian]] #idea --> pane that cycles through predefined "til" or quotes or reminders or random past notes with configurable change frequency

what are css snippets for in obsidian? #question 

---
### Inbox
- [[quartz]] doesn't include dataview compatible functionality. [[dataview]] tables don't work. but maybe would be helpful to use in private/internal notes before they're published to the [[digital garden]]
- native frontmatter properties
	- tags
	- aliases
	- cssclass
- can we use search queries in embeds? #question/answered 
	- yes

# How I Use it
![[20240313.052951PM]]
- [x] enable [[raindrop.io]] #plugin

# Sync Process
- obsidian sync 
- .git in parent directory
	- when updates are pushed, [[vercel]] deploys

# Tried, Didn't like
- obsidian/git integration. can't remember why i ended up deactivating it. 

# Todos
- [ ] standardize obsidian metadata/attributes
- [ ] how else can i use [[dataview]], what else can it show me that would be helpful? 
	- notes w/o tags

the shortcut for toggling editing mode is ctrl + e (and preview mode) #til [[obsidian]]
